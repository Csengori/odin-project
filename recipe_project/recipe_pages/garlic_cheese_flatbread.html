<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 packet of 2 fresh flatbreads (naan or pita</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons (60g) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, finely grated</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated parmesan, optional</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To make the garlic herb flatbread: Preheat your oven to 350ºF (180ºC). In a shallow plate or bowl, mash butter with olive oil, parsley, garlic, and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Once completely smooth, set aside.</li>
    <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil (we like foil as it can prevent melted butter from dripping around. You can also use parchment paper). Lay your flatbread on the baking sheet, forming rims with the aluminum foil around each flatbread. Then spread the garlic herb butter mixture on top (keep some of the butter mixture to make a fresh dip or spread). Bake in your oven for 10 mins, until butter is bubbly and the flatbread is golden on the edge.</li>
    <li>Remove the flatbreads from the oven and transfer to a cutting board lined with parchment paper. Sprinkle with grated parmesan, if you like, and slice the garlic herb butter flatbreads horizontally and serve immediately with a side of the fresh garlic herb butter. Enjoy!</li>
